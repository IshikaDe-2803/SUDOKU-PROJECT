# Sudoku-Project-WE

## Name
The Sudoku Project

## Description
The goal of this project is to investigate a variety of algorithms (backtracking, brute force, stochastic search and Crookâ€™s algorithm) that are capable of solving sudoku puzzles, of ranging difficulties, in order to learn more about sudoku solving techniques.
We also wanted to use the OpenCV library to read a sudoku from an image and solve it. This was a project to feed our curiosity in the domains of computer vision and deep learning.

## Future Scope
1. Implement a sudoku solver in Haskell and Elixir
2. Explore more algorithms like dancing links algorithm

## Authors and acknowledgment
This project was made by Yashvi Donga and Ishika De.
